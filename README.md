# SentAnalysis-to-Keyword

We tried a handful of DNN-based approaches for sentiment analysis of Korean texts. Attempted algorithms were: **CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM. Tensorflow(Keras BE)** was used for modeling.

After comparing each model's performances, we concluded that a CNN-based approach was the best, and linked it to a **TextRank** algorithm to check which words triggered the model to properly/improperly classify a text as positive or negative.

I was responsible for modeling sentimental analysis models, and comparing their performances.
